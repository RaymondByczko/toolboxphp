The purpose of this repo is to contain a set of PHP utilities
that serve a purpose in software development.  Essentially
it should make life easier and faster.

This can include anything from php code that looks at mysql
databases, to general frameworks to help come up with a 
web page fast.  (This is much better than coming up with
a set of pages too slowly for an impatient client.

Every utility is given its own directory in the toolboxphp
repository.

* hasdbchanged - a set of php files for querying into
running mysql databases, and determines if the database has
changed.  It is envisioned this would be a script running
under crontab, so that you the developer can see if the
database admin guy/gal has pulled the rug from under php
code by changing column names etc.
