Change dates: 2012-02-12 - added ctlwebservice

The purpose of this repo is to contain a set of PHP utilities
that serve a purpose in software development.  Essentially
it should make life easier and faster.

This can include anything from php code that looks at mysql
databases, to general frameworks to help come up with a 
web page fast.  (This is much better than coming up with
a set of pages too slowly for an impatient client.

Every utility is given its own directory in the toolboxphp
repository.

* hasdbchanged - a set of php files for querying into
running mysql databases, and determines if the database has
changed.  It is envisioned this would be a script running
under crontab, so that you the developer can see if the
database admin guy/gal has pulled the rug from under php
code by changing column names etc. 

* ctlwebservice - a demo code set for control something via
a web service (SOAP).  The 'something' is a table whose
height and angle can be adjusted.  (The table is assumed to
be on a central axle and can be rotated.)  This code demonstrates
using GET (or POST) along with SOAP and logging via syslog.
Database capability will be added shortly.
