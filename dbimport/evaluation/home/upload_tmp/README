@purpose This file serves to mark a location.  That is, under the home
subdirectory will be the upload_tmp directory, which contains this
README.  This directory is to temporary store uploaded temporary files
before they are moved to their more permanent location.  Putting this
file in git will insure the upload_tmp directory is present during
deployment.
