@purpose This file serves to mark a location.  That is, under the home
subdirectory will be the stored_xls directory, which contains this
README.  This directory is to permanently store uploaded files
before they are processed, and something (e.g. a graph) is produced.
Putting this file in git will insure the stored_xls directory is present during
deployment.
